ISSUE: Hyper Terminal doesn't launch

- After installation Hyper Terminal wouldn't open
- I could instigate an error by running # sudo /usr/bin/hyper
	- # error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0
- Also couldn't launch in xterm with # sudo xinit /usr/bin/hyper $* -- :1
	- May have been unrelated

FIX: Install GTK2

- It seems libgtk2-x11-2.0.so.0 is a part of GTK2
- # sudo pacman -S gtk2
