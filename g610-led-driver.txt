- Allow user to execute g610 driver without password so it can be scripted:
	- # sudo visudo
	- Add line: solomon ALL:NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/g610-led
- Make it automatically set to 100% brightness on boot by adding the following to /etc/g810-led/profile:
	- # Set all keys to white
	- a ffffff
	- # Set logo to white
	- k logo ffffff
	- # Commit the change

- Make this effective on startup by adding to ~/.xinitrc
	- g610-led -p /etc/g810-led/profile
